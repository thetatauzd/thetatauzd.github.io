+first, remove link to twitter (at least for now because its inactive)
+have the live Instagram post where the current social media buttons are and make it manually update (possibly have it set up so that PR chairs can easily change the post themselves)
+create a new section, above the About Theta Tau section, called "Community" and put our "pinned" Facebook post there (set it up so that any pinned post will automatically be put on the page or make it manual if that is not possible).
